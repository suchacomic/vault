# Chaslesâ€™ Theorem
- Consider a rigid body undergoing arbitrary motion. Pick any point $P$ in the body. Then at any instance, the motion of the body can be written as the sum of the [[Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration|translational motion]] of $P$,plus the [[Rotational Motion|rotational motion]] around some axis (which may change with time) through $P$.

# Angular Momentum of a Moving Body
- Let $z$ be the axis of rotation, the $z$ component of [[Conservation of Angular Momentum#Angular Momentum|angular momentum]] $L_{z}$, is the sum of two terms:
	1. The angular momentum $I_{0}\omega$ due to rotation of the body around its [[Center of Mass|center of mass]].
	2. The angular momentum due to motion of the center of mass with respect to the origin of the [[Reference Frame#Inertial Reference Frame|inertial coordinate system]]
	$$L_{z}=I_{0}\omega + (\mathbf{R}\times M\mathbf{V})_{z}$$Where $\mathbf{R}$ is a vector from the origin to the center of mass, $\mathbf{V}=\dot{\mathbf{R}}$ and $I_{0}$ is the moment of inertia around the center of mass.
- These two terms are referred to as the spin and the orbital angular momentum respectively.  
- The spin angular momentum is independent if the coordinate system, whereas the orbital angular momentum disappears if the origin is chosen to lie along the line of motion. 
# Torque on a Moving Body
- The torque also naturally divides itself into two terms. The torque on a body is $$\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\tau}  &= \sum \mathbf{r}_{j}\times \mathbf{f}_{j} \\
&= \sum(\mathbf{r}')
\end{align}$$
