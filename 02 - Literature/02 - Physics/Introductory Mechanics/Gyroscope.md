# Gyroscope 
![[99 - Meta/02 - Excalidraw/Drawings/ED-gyroscope.excalidraw]]
- The flywheel is initially bought up to speed, spinning at rate $\omega_{s}$. If the gyroscope is then released horizontally with one  end still supported by the pivot, the gyroscope begins a uniform precession, slowly rotating around the vertical axis with a constant [[Rotational Motion#Angular Velocity|angular velocity]] $\Omega$. 
- If the axle is help in space, the gyroscopeâ€™s angular momentum $\mathbf{L}_{s}$ is due entirely to the spin of its flywheel and is directed along the axle with magnitude $L_{s}=I_{0\,}\omega_{s}$, where $I_{0}$ is the [[Moment of Inertia|moment of inertia]] of the flywheel about the axle. 
- When the gyroscope precesses about the $z$ axis it also has a small orbital [[Conservation of Angular Momentum#Angular Momentum|angular momentum]].
- $\mathbf{L}_{s}$ always points along the axle. As the gyroscope precesses, $\mathbf{L}_{s}$ rotates with it. If the rate of precession is $\Omega$, the rate of change of $\mathbf{L}_{s}$ is given by $$\left\lvert  \frac{d\mathbf{L}_{s}}{dt}\right\rvert = \Omega L_{s}$$
- The direction of $d\mathbf{L}_{s} / dt$ is tangential to the horizontal circle swept out by $\mathbf{L}_{s}$. 
- There must by a [[Conservation of Angular Momentum#Torque|torque]] on the gyroscope to account for the change in $\mathbf{L}_{s}$. The source of the torque is due to the weight of the flywheel $\mathbf{W}$.
- If we take the pivot as the origin, the magnitude of torque is $$\tau=lW$$$\tau$ is parallel to $d\mathbf{L}_{s}/dt$.
- The rate of precession $\Omega$ can be obtained from the relation $$\begin{align} \left\lvert  \frac{d\mathbf{L}_{s}}{dt}  \right\rvert &= \tau \\ \Omega L_{s} &= lW \\ \end{align}$$$$\bbox[15px, border:1px solid white]{\Omega = \frac{lW}{I_{0}\,\omega_{s}}}$$
