# Angular Momentum 
- The angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ of a particle that has [[Conservation of Momentum#Momentum|momentum]] $\mathbf{p}$ and is at position $\mathbf{r}$ with respect to a given coordinate system:$$\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p}$$
- $\mathbf{L}$ explicitly depends upon $\mathbf{r}$, thus contrary to linear momentum $\mathbf{p}$, the value of $\mathbf{L}$ depends not only on the motion of the particle, but also on its location with respect to the origin of a particular coordinate system.
- The [[Vector|vectors]] $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{p}$ determines a [[Equation of Plane|plane]] called the plane of motion, and by the properties of the [[Vector Operations#Cross Product|cross product]], $\mathbf{L}$ is perpendicular to the plane.
- The direction of $\mathbf{L}$ is dictated by the [[Right-Hand Rule|right-hand rule]].
