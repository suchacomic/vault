# Frame of Reference 
- A frame of reference is an arbitrary set of axes from which the position and motion of of an object is described 
# Inertial Reference Frame
- If the frame of reference $\mathcal{S}$ is subject to zero [[Fundamental Forces|force]] and hence is not [[Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration#Acceleration|accelerating]] and the [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Newtonâ€™s First Law|the law of inertia]] holds, we call $\mathcal{S}$ an **inertial frame**.
- If we consider a second frame $\mathcal{S'}$ which is moving relative to $\mathcal{S}$ with constant [[Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration#Velocity Vector|velocity]] and is not rotating, then an object in $\mathcal{S}$  will appear to move with a constant velocity relative to $\mathcal{S}'$ 
# Non-Inertial Frame of Reference
- If a frame of reference $\mathcal{S}''$ that is accelerating relative to $\mathcal{S}$, then, as viewed from $\mathcal{S}''$, an object in $\mathcal{S}$ will be seen to be accelerating in the opposite direction relative to the accelerating frame $\mathcal{S}''$.
- We say that the law of inertia does not hold, and we say that $\mathcal{S}''$ is **non-inertial**.
