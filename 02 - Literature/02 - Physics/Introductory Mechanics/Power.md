# Power
- Power is the rate at which work is done. 
- The work $\Delta W$ by the force $\mathbf{F}$ on a system as it moves through as short distance $\Delta \mathbf{r}$ is $\mathbf{F}\Delta \mathbf{r}$. If the displacement takes place during the time $\Delta t$, then the rate of work is $$\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} \approx \mathbf{F}\cdot \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t}$$
- In the [[Limits|limit]] $\Delta t\to {0}, \Delta r/\Delta t\to v$,$$\bbox[15px, border:1px solid white]{P=\frac{dW}{dt}=\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}}$$
