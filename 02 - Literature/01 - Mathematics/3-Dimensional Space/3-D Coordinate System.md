# Three Dimensional Cartesian Coordinate System
- The 3-D Coordinate system is often denoted by $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

- The point $P$ is the general point sitting out in 3-D space. If we start at $P$ and drop straight down we reach a $z$-coordinate of zero we arrive at the point $Q$.
- We say that $Q$ sits in the $xy$-[[Equation of Plane|plane]]. The $xy$-plane corresponds to all the points which have a zero $z$-coordinate, collectively, the $xy$, $xz$ and $yz$-planes are sometimes called the coordinate planes.
- The point $Q$ is often referred as the projection of $P$ in the $xy$-plane 
- The distance between ant two points in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is given by,$$d(P_{1},P_{2})=\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{2})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2} }$$## See also
