# Quadric Surfaces
- Quadric surfaces are the graphs of ant equation that can be put into the general form $$
Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cx^{2}+Dxy+Exz+Fyz+Gx+Hy+Iz+J=0$$where $A,B,\dots,J$ are constants.
# Ellipsoid  
- The general equation of an ellipsoid is,$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}+\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}=1$$

- With $a=b=c$ then we will have a sphere.
# Cone 
- The general equation of a cone is,$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}$$	![[cone.png]]
- For only the upper or lower portion we modify the equation as, $$
z = \pm \sqrt{ A^{2}x^{2}+b^{2}y^{2} }$$
# Cylinder 
- The general equation of a cylinder is,$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$$This is a cylinder whose cross section is a ellipse. If $a=b$ we have a cylinder whose cross section is a circle with the equation, $$
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$$![[cylinder surface.png]]
# Hyperboloid of One Sheet
- The equation of a hyperboloid of one sheet is,$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}-\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}=1$$![[1 sheet hyperboloid.png]]
- The variable with the negative in front of it will give the axis along which the graph is centered.
# Hyperboloid of Two Sheets
- The equation of a hyperboloid of two sheets is,$$
-\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}+\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}=1$$![[2 sheet hyperboloid.png]]
- The variable with the positive in front of it will give the axis along which the graph is centered.
# Elliptic Paraboloid 
- The equation of an elliptic paraboloid is,$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\frac{z}{c}$$As with cylinders this has a cross section of an ellipse and if $a=b$ it will have a cross section of a circle.

- The sign of c will determine the direction that the paraboloid opens. If c is positive then it opens up and if c is negative then it opens down.
# Hyperbolic Paraboloid
- The equation of an hyperbolic paraboloid is,$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\frac{z}{c}$$
- These graphs are vaguely saddle shaped and as with the elliptic paraboloid the sign of c will determine the direction in which the surface “opens up”.![[hyperbolic paraboloid.png]]
