- For integrating powers of sine and cosine in the form, $$\int \sin^{n}x\cos^{m}\, dx$$
if either $n$ or $m$ are odd, take the function with the odd exponent, strip ope power and convert it to its complimentary function ($\sin^{2}x+\cos ^{2}x=1$). If both $m$ and $n$ are odd chose either function. Then use a substitution.
- For exponents of $\sec$ following general formula can be used,$$		\int \sec ^{m}\theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{m-1}\tan\theta \sec^{m-2}\theta+\frac{m-2}{m-1}\int \sec ^{m-2}\theta \, d\theta$$
