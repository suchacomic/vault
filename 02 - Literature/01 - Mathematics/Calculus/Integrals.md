# Indefinite Integral
- Given a [[Function]], $f(x)$, an anti-[[Derivatives|derivative]] of $f(x)$ is any function $F(x)$ such that, $$
F'(x)=f(x)$$
- If $F(x)$ is any anti-derivative of $f(x)$ then the most general anti-derivative of $f(x)$ is called an **indefinite integral** and denoted,$$\int f(x) \, dx = F(x)+c,\hspace{0.5in}c\text{ is an arbitart constant}$$

- In this definition the $\int$ is called the **integral symbol**, $f(x)$ is called the **integrand**, $x$ is called the **integration variable** and the “$c$” is called the **constant of integration**.
# Properties of Indefinite Integrals
1. $\displaystyle\int kf(x) \, dx=k\int  f(x) \, dx$ where $k$ is any number. 
2. $\displaystyle \int -f(x) \, dx=-\int f(x) \, dx$. This is really the first property with $k=-1$
3. $\displaystyle \int f(x)\pm g(x) \, dx=\int f(x) \, dx\pm \int gx \, dx$
