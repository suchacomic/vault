1. Simplify the integrand, if possible. 
2. See if a “simple” substitution will work.
3. **Identify the type of integral**.
	1. If the integrand a rational expression $\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)$, then partial fractions may work on the integral.
	2. If the integrand a polynomial times a trig function, exponential, or logarithm, then integration by parts may work.
	3. If the integrand a product of sines and cosines, secant and [[Rate of Change and Tangent Line#Tangent|tangents]], or co-secants and cotangents, complimentary formulas can be used to transform on function of the product to the other.
	4. If the integrand involves $\sqrt{ b^{2}x^{2}+a^{2}}$ , $\sqrt {{b^2}{x^2} - {a^2}}$ or $\sqrt {{a^2} - {b^2}{x^2}}$, then a trig substitution might work.
	5. If the integrand have roots other than those listed above in, then the substitution $u=\sqrt[n]{g(x)}$ might work.
	6. If the integrand have a quadratic in it, then completing the square on the quadratic might put it into a form that we can deal with.
4. We use a substitution or manipulation to write the integrand into a form that does fit into the forms we’ve looked at previously.
5. Use multiple techniques.
