# Finding Absolute [[Extremum in one Variable]]
1. Verify that a [[Function]] is [[Continuity|continuous]] on the interval $[a,b]$.
2. Find all the [[Extremum in one Variable#Stationary Points|critical]] points of $f(x)$ that are in the interval $[a,b]$.
3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and the end points.
4. Identify the absolute [[Extremum in one Variable#Maxima and Minima|extrema]].
# First [[Derivatives|Derivative]] Test
Suppose that $x=c$ is a critical point of $f(x)$ then,

1. if $f'(x)>0$ to the left of $x=c$ and $f'(x)<0$ to the right of $x=c$ then $x=c$ is a relative maximum.
2. if $f'(x)<0$ to the left of $x=c$ and $f'(x)>0$ to the right of $x=c$ then $x=c$ is a relative minimum.
3. If $f'(x)$ is the same sign on both sides of $x=c$ then $x=c$ is neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum.

# Second Derivative Test
- Suppose that $x=c$ is a critical point of $f(x)$ such that $f'(x)=0$ and $f''(x)$ is continuous in a region around $x=c$. Then,
	
	1. If $f''(c)<0$ then $x=c$ is a relative maximum.
	2. If $f''(c)>0$ then $x=c$ is a relative minimum.
	3. if $f''(c)=o$ then $x=c$ can be a relative maximum, relative minimum of neither. 
- This is basically calculating how the slopes of tangents are changing,
	1. $-ve\to+ve$ : Minima
	2. $+ve\to-ve$ : Minima
