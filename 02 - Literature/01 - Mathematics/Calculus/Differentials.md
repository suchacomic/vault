- Given a function $y-f(x)$ we call $dy$ and $dx$ differentials and the relationship between them is given by,$$dx=f'(x)dx$$
- For more than one variable we use [[Partial Derivatives|partial derivatives]] instead of [[Derivatives|ordinary derivatives]]. Given the function $w=f(x,y,z)$, $$\begin{align}
dw &= f_{x}dx+f_{y}dy+f_{z}dz \\ \\
&= \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } dx+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } dy+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z } dz  
\end{align}$$
