# Indeterminant Form
- **Indeterminate form** is a mathematical expression that can obtain any value depending on circumstances. 
- Limit usually take an **indeterminate form**, described by one of the informal expressions $${\displaystyle {\frac {0}{0}},~{\frac {\infty }{\infty }},~0\times \infty ,~\infty -\infty ,~0^{0},~1^{\infty },{\text{ or }}\infty ^{0},}$$
# L’Hôpital’s Rule
Suppose that we have one of the following cases,$$\lim_{ x \to a } \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{0}{0} \hspace{0.25in} \text{OR} \hspace{0.25in} \lim_{ x \to a } \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{{\pm\infty}}{\pm \infty}$$where $a$ can be any real number, infinity or negative infinity. In these cases we have,$$\lim_{ x \to a } \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{ x \to a } \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$
