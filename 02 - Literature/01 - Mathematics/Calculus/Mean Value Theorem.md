# Rolleâ€™s Theorem
Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that satisfies all of the following.
1. $f(x)$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] on the closed interval $[a,b]$.
2. $f(x)$ is differentiable on the closed interval $(a,b)$.Or in other words $f(x)$ has a critical point in $(a,b)$.
# Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem
Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that satisfies both of the following.
1. $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$.
2. $f(x)$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$
Then there is a number $c$ such that $a<c<b$ and $$
f'(c)=\frac{{f(b)-f(a)}}{b-a}

$$
