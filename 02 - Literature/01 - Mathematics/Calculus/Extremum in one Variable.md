# Stationary Points
 - We say that $x=c$ is a critical point or stationary points of the function $f(x)$ if $f(c)$ exists and if either of the following are true.$$f'(c)=0\hspace{0.5in} OR \hspace{0.5in}f'(c)\ \mbox{ doesn't exist}$$
# Maxima and Minima
## Definition
#### Absolute / Global
1. We say that $f(x)$ ha an absolute maxima at $x=c$ if $f(x)\leq f(c)$ for every $x$ in the [[Function|domain]] we are working on.
2. We say that $f(x)$ has a absolute minima at $x=c$ if $f(x)\geq f(c)$ for every $x$ in the domain we are working on
### Relative / Local
1. We say that $f(x)$ has an relative maximum at $x=c$ if $f(x)\leq f(c)$ for every $x$ in some open interval around $x=c$
2. We say that $f(x)$ has an relative minimum at $x=c$ if $f(x)\geq f(c)$ for every $x$ in some open interval around $x=c$

# Extreme Value Theorem
- Suppose that $f(x)$ is a [[Continuity|continuous]] on the interval $[a,b]$ then <u>there are</u> two numbers $a\leq c,d\leq b$ so that $f(c)$ is an absolute maximum and $f(d)$ is an absolute minimum foe the function.
- For a continuous function on an interval $[a,b]$ we are guaranteed to have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in that interval
# Fermat's Theorem
- If $f(x)$ has a relative extrema at $x=c$ and $f'(c)$ exists then $x=c$ is a critical point of $f(x)$. In Fact, it will be a critical point such that $f'(c) = 0$
