# Monotonicity
- We say that a function is _increasing on an interval_ $I$ if for all $x_{1},x_{2}\in I$ with $x_{1}<x_{2}$ we have $f(x_{1})<f(x_{2})$.
- We say that $f(x)$ is _decreasing in an interval_ $I$ if for all$x_{1},x_{2}\in I$with $x_{1}<x_{2}$ we have $f(x_{1})>f(x_{2})$.
- A function is said to be **monotonic** on an interval $I$ if it is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing in $I$.
### Monotonicity Theorem
If $f(x)$ is so that $f'(x)>0$ for all $x$ in the interval $I$, then $f(x)$ is increasing on $I$. If $f'(c)<0$ for all $x$ in $I$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing on $I$.

# Concavity
- We say that $f(x)$ is _concave up_ on an interval $I$ if $f''(x)>0$ on $I$. We say that $f(x)$ in _concave down_ on $I$ if $f’’(x)<0$ on $I$. 
- If $c$ is a point in the [[Function#Domain|domain]] on $f(x)$, and if $f(x)$ has one type of concavity on $(a,c)$ and other type on $c,b$, then we say that that point $(c,f(c))$ is a _point of inflection_ of $f(x)$.
