# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- If $f(x)$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] on $[a,b]$ then,$$
g(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt $$is continuous on $[a,b]$ and it is [[Derivatives|differentiable]] on $(a,b)$ and,$$
g'(x)=f(x)
$$
Or,$$
$$$$\frac{d}{dx}\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt=f(x) $$
- Suppose $f(x)$ is a continuous [[Function]] on $[a,b]$ and also suppose that $F(x)$ is any [[Integrals|anti-derivative]] for $f(x)$. Then,$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx =F(x)|_a^b=F(b)-F(a)
$$
# Leibnizâ€™ Rule 
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_{u(x)}^{v(x)} f(t) \, dt=f(v)\ \frac{dv}{dx}-f(u)\ \frac{du}{dx} 
$$
