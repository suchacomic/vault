# Average Function Value

The Average value of a [[Continuity|continuous]] function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a,b]$ is give by,$$
f_{avg}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$

# Mean Value Theorem for [[Integrals]].

If $f(x)$ is a continuous function on $[a,b]$ then there is a number $c$ in $[a,b]$ such that,$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = f(c)(b-a)$$
Or, in other words, if f(x) is a continuous function then somewhere in $[a,b]$ the function will take on its average value.
