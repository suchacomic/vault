# Closed 
- A path $C$ is called **closed** if its initial and final points are the same point. For example, a circle is a closed path.  
# Simple
- A path $C$ is **simple** if it doesn’t cross itself. A circle is a simple curve while a figure 8 type curve is not simple.  
# Open
- A region $D$ is **open** if it doesn’t contain any of its boundary points.  
# Connected
- A region $D$ is **connected** if we can connect any two points in the region with a path that lies completely in $D$.  
## Simple Connected
- A region $D$ is **simply-connected** if it is connected and it contains no holes. We won’t need this one until the next section, but it fits in with all the other definitions given here so this was a natural place to put the definition.
