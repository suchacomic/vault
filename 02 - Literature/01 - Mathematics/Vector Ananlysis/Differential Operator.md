# Del Operator 
The $\nabla$ is a [[Vector|vector]] operator usually called a _differential operator_ or *Del operator* and written as,$$
\nabla = \hat{x}\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x } +\hat{y}\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y } +\hat{x}\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z }$$
# Operation on Scalars 
$\nabla \phi$ where $\phi$ is a scalar is called the [[Gradient|gradient]] of $\phi$.
# Operation on vector 
- $\nabla\cdot \vec{F}$ , where $\vec{F}$ is a vector is called the [[Divergence]] of $\vec{F}$.
- $\nabla \times \vec{F}$ is called the [[Curl]] of $\vec{F}$
