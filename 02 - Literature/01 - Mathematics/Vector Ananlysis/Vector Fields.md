# Scalar and Vector Fields
- The term *field* is used to mean both the region and the value of the field quantity in the region.
- If the physical quantity is a scalar, we speak of **scalar field**.
- If the physical quantity is [[Vector|vector]], we speak of **vector field**.
- A vector field on a [[3-D Coordinate System|three dimensional space]] is as [[Vector Functions| function]] $\vec{F}$ that assigns to each point $(x,y,z)$ a three dimensional vector given by $\vec{F}(x,y,z)$, $$\vec{F}(x,y,x)=P(x,y,z)\,\hat{x}+Q(x,y,z)\,\hat{y}+R(x,y,z)\,\hat{z}$$Where the functions $P$,$Q$,$R$ are called **scalar functions**.
- The [[Gradient|gradient vector]] defined by,$$\nabla f=\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z} \rangle $$This is a vector field and if often called a **gradient vector field** where the function $f(x,y,z)$ is a scalar function.
# Contour Lines
- For a function $z=f(x,y)$ we mark a series of curves each corresponding to some value of $k$, these curves of constant “elevation” are often called **contour lines** or **level curves**.
