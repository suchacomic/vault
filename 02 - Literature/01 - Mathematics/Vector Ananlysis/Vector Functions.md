- A vector-valued function, also referred to as a [[Vector|vector]] [[Function|function]], is a mathematical function of one or more variables whose [[Function#Range|range]] is a set of multidimensional vectors.
- The input of a vector-valued function could be a scalar or a vector, i.e. the dimension of the [[Function#Domain|domain]] could be 1 or greater than 1.
- The dimension of the functionâ€™s domain has no relation to the dimension of its range.
- For example a vector function of a single variable in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ has the form,$$
\vec{r}(t)=\langle f(t),g(t),h(t) \rangle $$where, $f(t),g(t)$ and $h(t)$ are called the *component functions*.
